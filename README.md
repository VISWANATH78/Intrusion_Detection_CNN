#Intrusion Detection System using Convolutional Neural Networks

This is a repository for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze network traffic and identify potential security threats or attacks.

The IDS can be trained on a dataset of known attacks to learn the characteristics of different types of attacks, such as DDoS, SQL injection, or malware. The CNN can then be used to analyze network traffic and predict the type of attack that is occurring.

The system can be used in two modes: training mode and testing mode. In training mode, the CNN is trained on a dataset of known attacks. In testing mode, the CNN is used to analyze network traffic and identify potential threats or attacks.

To use the system, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal.

Run python main.py in your terminal to start the program.

Choose the mode you want to use (training or testing).

If you choose the training mode, you need to provide a dataset of known attacks. The dataset should be in PCAP format. The program will preprocess the data and train the CNN.

If you choose the testing mode, you need to provide a PCAP file containing network traffic data. The CNN will analyze the data and predict the type of attack that is occurring.

The program will output the results to the console.

The system is designed to be easy to use and can be customized to fit your needs. You can adjust the CNN architecture, change the dataset, or modify the preprocessing steps to improve the system's performance.

If you have any questions or issues with the system, please feel free to open an issue in this repository. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community.
